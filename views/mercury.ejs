  	<p id="mercury">Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. Mercury is the smallest planet â€” it is only slightly larger than Earth's moon. Mercury speeds around the sun every 88 Earth days, traveling through space at nearly 112,000 mph, faster than any other planet. Its oval-shaped orbit is highly elliptical, taking Mercury as close as 29 million miles and as far as 43 million miles from the sun. If one could stand on Mercury when it is nearest to the sun, it would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth. About 4 billion years ago, an asteroid roughly 60 miles wide struck Mercury with an impact equal to 1-trillion 1-megaton bombs, creating a vast impact crater roughly 960 miles wide. Known as the Caloris Basin, this crater could hold the entire state of Texas.</p>
